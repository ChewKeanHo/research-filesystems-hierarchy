# `/root/.local/src`

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This is the user-specific directory housing user supplied, non-critical,
user-specific, source files (e.g. C source codes) personalized for `root`
account.

Generally, you **SHOULD** place `root` account's custom source files here.

All files here are available only to the `root` account.

This directory is **ENTIRELY OPTIONAL** as it serves as a clean design
structure.




## Naming Conventions

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

It is a practice to house the files using `trademark` and `product`
sub-directories pattern. This can significantly reduces the naming collision for
common names.

Here are the examples:

```
/root/.local/src/
  trademark/
    product/
      lib1.c
      lib1_freebsd-amd64.c
      kernel8.c
      kernel8_freebsd-amd64.c
      ...

# OR

/root/.local/src/
  product/
    lib1.c
    lib1_freebsd-amd64.c
    kernel8.c
    kernel8_freebsd-amd64.c
    ...
```
