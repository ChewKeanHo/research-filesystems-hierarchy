# `/root/.local/share/fonts`

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This is the user-specific directory housing user supplied, non-critical,
user-specific font files personalized for `root` account.

Generally, you **SHOULD** place `root` account custom font files here.

All files here are available only to the `root` account.

This directory is **ENTIRELY OPTIONAL** as it serves as a clean design
structure.




## Naming Conventions

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

It is a practice to house the files using `trademark` and `product`
sub-directories pattern. This can significantly reduces the naming collision for
common names.

Here are the examples:

```
/root/.local/share/fonts/
  trademark/
    product1/
      font1.tff
      LICENSE.txt
      ...
    product2/
      font2.tff
      LICENSE.txt
      ...
    ...

# OR

/root/.local/share/fonts/
  product1/
    font1.tff
    LICENSE.txt
    ...
  product2/
    font2.tff
    LICENSE.txt
    ...
  ...
```
